# React Tetris (backend)

-   My first backend project built from scratch with **Node.js** and **MySQL**

-   **SQL** database for and server for [**React-tetris**](https://github.com/0iseaux/React-tetris-frontend) (Gameplay temporarily unavailable)

-   Supports saving players' names, scores, and current date/time, generating the player's rank and retreving top players' records for rendering on the Score Board page
